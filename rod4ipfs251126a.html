      <HR><BR><BR>
        I was hacked.<BR>
<BR>
I exposed a ".env" file for a minute.<BR>
Minimal damage in the big picture.<BR>
Maximal lesson learned.<BR>
<BR>
Am working to restore functionality.

        <H2 style="font-family: serif">About Naming Design</H2>
        Imagine yourself in a hardware store. In the back.<BR>
        Look at that wall of cards with the colors on them.<BR>
        All those colors have names.<BR>
        What committee got together to decide on the names of those colors?<BR>
        For ALL those colors!<BR>
        Look, I'm sorry, but some of those names are pretty silly.<BR>
        (Except "firetruck red". They weren't kidding.)<BR>
        I believe... you & I can do better.<BR>
        More creative names, or at least less boring ones.<BR>
        More culturally diverse names, or at least ones in different languages.<BR>
        More meaningful names, or at least ones with an interesting story.<BR>
        So that's what this Rockopera Color project lets you do.<BR><BR>
        <b>Collect 1 NFT color swatch for each of the over 16 million web colors.</b><BR><BR>
        And maybe have some fun along the way.<BR>
        <BR>
        <H2 style="font-family: serif">About Owning Design</H2>
        Imagine owning a color. Let's say it's that "firetruck red".<BR>
        You own it. Congrats. It's yours now.<BR>
        Do you know what this means?<BR>
        Neither do I.<BR>
        It doesn't feel right to own something available to all of us.<BR>
        It doesn't make sense to own something intangible.<BR>
        It doesn't seem remotely similar to owning other things.<BR>
        Yet that's why I'm drawn to this project.<BR><BR>
        <b>By tokenizing color, I'm making something intangible, tangible.</b><BR><BR>
        And now we enable something new.<BR>
        <BR>
        <H2 style="font-family: serif">About Onchain Art</H2>
        Imagine you're about to sign an important document.<BR>
        What color is the ink of the pen in your hand?<BR>
        I bet it's either blue or black.<BR>
        Like I know I've been told are the only acceptable colors.<BR>
        For signing checks at a bank.<BR>
        But what if you could sign it in YOUR "firetruck red"?<BR>
        Then all the peoples would know that that signature was definitely yours.<BR>
        Because ONLY YOU have that color.<BR>
        That color just became your signature color.<BR>
        (Pun intended.)<BR>
        Now... let's be real.<BR>
        Nobody's stopping other "firetruck red" pens from being made.<BR>
        Nobody's preventing your pen from being stolen.<BR>
        Nobody's saying you couldn't accidentally lose your pen.<BR>
        Now... let's be Web3.<BR>
        Nobody could duplicate the token, depending on the contract's type.<BR>
        Nobody could steal the token, depending on the contract's security.<BR>
        Nobody could lose the token, depending on the owner's onchain practices.<BR>
        Sure, we'd need dApps that would only accept this specific source of color.<BR>
        From a set of sources of artistic building blocks.<BR>
        So that's what I'm building. (Incrementally.)<BR>
        And releasing along the way. (Iteratively.)<BR>
        Even if it's ugly like this page. (Transparently.)<BR><BR>
        <b>To make more onchain art work, we need more onchain art tech.</b><BR><BR>
        And thus this lowers the barrier for each of us.<BR>
        For you.<BR>
        To create and share, and now own, your rockopera.<BR>
